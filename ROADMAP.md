# SteamPulse — Roadmap

## ✅ Done

### v1.0.0 — Core
- `steampulse` CLI (fetch + render in one step)
- Standalone Windows EXE via PyInstaller
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (lint + types + tests + release)

### v1.0.1 — Packaging fix
- Correct `pyproject.toml` wheel package declaration

### v1.1.0 — UI & i18n
- Two-layer collapsible toolbar (library + news pages)
- "Màj récente" filter (last-patch-ts window: 2/5/15/30 days)
- Multilingual support (EN / FR) — `--lang` flag
- URL hash persistence for all filters

### v1.2.0 — Multi-store (Epic Games) — *in `develop`, not yet released*
- **`GameSource` plugin architecture** — `sources/` package, runtime-checkable Protocol, `get_all_sources()` registry; new stores can be added without touching `cli.py`
- **Epic Games Store source** (`EpicSource`) — OAuth2 auth (authorization code on first login, device credentials for subsequent headless runs)
- **Steam AppID resolver chain** (`resolver.py`) — `SteamStoreResolver` (Steam Store Search + fuzzy matching) → `IGDBResolver` (Twitch OAuth + IGDB); first hit wins; results cached in `appid_mappings` DB table
- **`appid_mappings` table** — caches external→Steam AppID resolutions; `manual=True` entries are protected from automatic overwrite
- **`external_id` field on `OwnedGame`** — identifies non-Steam games (e.g. `"epic:<catalogItemId>"`)
- **Epic display in HTML dashboards** — "🎮 Epic" filter button, store badge on cards, context-aware playtime label
- **New CLI flags**: `--epic-auth-code`, `--epic-device-id`, `--epic-account-id`, `--epic-device-secret`, `--twitch-client-id`, `--twitch-client-secret`
- **UX**: per-game progress indicator during Epic AppID resolution + resolved/unresolved summary
- 168 tests total

## 🔵 Planned / Not yet started

### Config file (TOML)
- Use stdlib `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) — no extra dependency
- Config file location: `~/.config/steampulse/config.toml` (XDG) or `%APPDATA%\steampulse\config.toml` on Windows
- Store persistent credentials: Steam API key, SteamID64, Epic device auth, Twitch client ID/secret
- CLI flags override config values (flags take precedence)
- Removes need to pass `--key`, `--steamid`, `--epic-device-id`, etc. on every run
- Migration: if config file exists and flag is omitted, read from config

### Manual AppID mappings CLI
- Interface to add/edit manual `appid_mappings` entries (e.g. `steam-fetch --add-mapping epic:Flier 1234567`)
- Useful for games that fail automatic resolution (e.g. Epic exclusives with no Steam page)
- `manual=True` entries already protected in DB — just needs a CLI surface

### Additional store plugins
- **GOG** — GOG Galaxy API or `gogdl` approach
- **Xbox Game Pass** — Xbox / Microsoft Store API
- **Amazon Prime Gaming** — library discovery
- Plugin architecture is already in place; adding a store = new `sources/<store>.py` file

### Collections
- User-defined groups to organize games across stores and statuses (e.g. "À finir", "Co-op avec amis", "Abandonné")
- Collections stored in the DB (`collections` and `collection_games` tables — additive migration)
- CLI surface to manage collections: `steam-fetch --add-to <collection> <appid|name>`, `--remove-from`, `--list-collections`
- HTML dashboard: collection filter group alongside Store / Collection status filters; a game can belong to multiple collections (multi-select, OR logic)
- Collections exported as part of the generated HTML (no server required)

## 💡 Ideas (not committed)

- Web UI / local HTTP server mode (vs. static HTML files)
- Automatic re-fetch on a schedule (daemon / cron mode)
- Game price history tracking (store prices as time series)
- Export to CSV / JSON
- **Per-game news timeline** — dedicated view (or expandable panel on the card) showing the full update history for a single game: chronological list of patch notes and news entries, each with its date, title, type tag (patch note / news), and a direct link to the article; useful to quickly assess how actively a game is maintained
